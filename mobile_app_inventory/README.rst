=============================================================================
Provide light Web app to scan products Barcode and generate Stock Inventories
=============================================================================

This module was written to extend the functionality of odoo Stock module.

This module provides a web app designed to work on a Mobile. The app allows
user to scan products and select a quantity to inventory. A draft inventory
is automatically created and updated.

Interface
=========

Authentication
--------------

The first screen asks Odoo credentials. The user should be member of the Odoo
'Warehouse / User' group.

Data Loading
------------

Once authenticated, some datas are cached : Active Products, Stock locations
and draft inventories.

Note: This step can take a while depending on your database product size and
depending on the product extra-fields you have choosen to display. (see
Extra fields Section)

Inventory Selection
-------------------

Once datas are loaded, user can select an existing draft stock inventory he
want to complete.

.. image:: /mobile_app_inventory/static/src/img/04_phone_select_stock_inventory.png

Alternatively, he can create a new stock inventory, tipping an inventory name.


Location Selection
------------------

Once the inventory created (or selected), user has to select the location where
he is for the time being.

Product Selection and Quantity Selection
----------------------------------------

Once the stock inventory is created or selected, the user can select a product,
scanning a barcode.

.. image:: /mobile_app_inventory/static/src/img/06_phone_select_product.png

If the EAN13 barcode is recognized, user has to set a quantity to inventory and
then validate.

If a line with the same product (and same location) already exist, an extra
screen is display to mention wich action to. (sum quantity, or replace the old
value by the one).

Menu
----

A menu is available in each screen that allows user to navigate between
screens.

Extra Fields
------------

In the company form, admin user can set extra fields that will be displayed
when a product is scanned. A typical use case is to display stock quantity
information.

This feature is interesting to display easily and without custom developpement
extra fields of the core, or custom extra fields.

Similar Projects
----------------

* You could be interested by another implementation of similar features
  'stock_scanner' in the same repository.

* You could be interested by the same kind of implementation for purchase
  workflow, that allow to create a purchase_order, with mobile device,
  scanning barcode and tiping desired quantity.
  `See 'scan_to_purchase' module on GRAP github repository <https://github.com/grap/odoo-addons-mobile/tree/7.0/scan_to_purchase>`_

Usage

If you're testing this module with demo data installed, you can test scanning
(or copying values) with the following two barcodes :

* 5400313040109 : Organic Chips (Paprika)
* 4260108510016 : Organic Beer (Gluten Free)

Roadmap / Current Limits
------------------------

* Dates displays does NOT change depending of the localization of the user

* JS and CSS lib are hard included. So if many apps are developped, it could
  be great to have a generic 'web_ionic' module that have all tools to avoid
  to duplicate files

Known Issues
------------

* Due to bad design of the module 'product_multi_ean' that changes type of
  code product ean13 field from char to many2one, 'mobile_app_inventory will not
  work if 'product_multi_ean' is installed. (Products loading will fail)
  This issue will not occur in V8+, due to refactoring of 'product_multi_ean'
  that fixes this bug.
  `See the bug report on Github <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-barcode/issues/52>`_

* Databases list on login view displays all databases, while only databases
  with 'mobile_app_inventory' module installed should be displayed. But this
  feature could not be implemented, due to current Odoo Core limitations

* **Firefox Ionic Bug** : The first screen allows user to select database,
  in a multi database context. This module use ionic select component, that
  doesn't not works On Firefox Mobile.
  `See the bug on Ionic Github <https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/4767>`_

* **Chrome Mobile limitation** : This module plays mp3 sounds when actions is,
  done. This feature is not available for Chrome Mobile for the time being,
  cause Chrome consider that allowing to play a sound without explicit action
  of the user raises security issues.
  `See the bug on Chromium website <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=178297>`_
