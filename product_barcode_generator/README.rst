Product barcode generator
=========================

This module will add a function which leads to an automatic generation of EAN13 for products

You will have to define the company default value (6 first numbers of EAN13) then the 6 next numbers of the sequence.

The 13rd is the control digit of the EAN13, this will be automatically computed.

The sequence to use to generate the ean13 can be specified at 3 levels (in the specified order):

* product
* category
* company
