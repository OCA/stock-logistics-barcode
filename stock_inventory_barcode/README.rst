The interface provided by Odoo in the official *stock* module to make an inventory has 2 limitations:

* it is not easy/fast to use when you have several thousand products

* you cannot use a barcode reader to scan the products

Other community modules such as *stock_barcodes* or *mobile_app_inventory* propose a mobile interface to operate inventories using smartphones with barcode scanners. This is the most advanced solution, but it requires special hardware and these modules are have a lot of lines of code.

This module is a small-and-simple module to make an inventory using the regular web interface of Odoo with a barcode reader.

Usage
=====

On the form view of an inventory, once the inventory has been started
(State = *In Progress*), you will see a button **Start Barcode
Interface**. It will open a pop-up window that allows the user to easily
enter the inventory quantity (or update the inventory quantity, in case
the product is found a second time at a different place during the
inventory).

The wizard screen is automatically adapted when the product is tracked by lot or serial, and if the inventory is made across several stock locations.
