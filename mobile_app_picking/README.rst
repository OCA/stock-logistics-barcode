**Colors depending on the quantity**

The field quantity will have a different background color depending on the
difference between expected and done quantity :

* ``white`` : no quantity set
* ``yellow`` : expected quantity not reached
* ``green`` : done quantity corresponds to the expected quantity
* ``red``: done quantity is over the expected quantity

**Typical Errors and Warning at the login screen**

* It will not possible to log in if the user is not member of the
  'Warehouse / User' group.


**Typical Errors and Warning at the scanner screen**

* 'Incorrect quantity' if the quantity entered is negative, or is not a float.

* 'Barcode not found in the picking' if the operator tries to scan a product
  that is not in the list of move lines.

* 'Many operations found' if there are many lines with the same products.
  In that case, the operator should select manually the line he want to treat.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* For the time being, this module doesn't handle 'Lot', 'Pack' and 'Owner'.

* The UI doesn't allow to add an unexpected product on the fly.

* In practice, the mobile app emulate the actions of the user, changing
  Done quantity of stock moves of a given picking.
  This action is allowed by odoo under certain conditions, that are
  defined by the field ``is_quantity_done_editable`` of the ``stock.picking``.
  Using this module if this field is unchecked could generate problems.
  This field is disabled (amoung others conditions) if user is member of
  ``stock.group_stock_multi_locations`` or ``stock.group_tracking_owner``
  See the functions ``_compute_show_details_visible`` and
  ``_compute_is_quantity_done_editable`` for more detals.

* Could be interesting to merge the two views ``list_move`` and
  ``main_scan`` into a single one module.
