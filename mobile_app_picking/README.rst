**Colors depending on the quantity**

The field quantity will have a different background color depending on the
difference between expected and done quantity :

* ``white`` : no quantity set
* ``yellow`` : expected quantity not reached
* ``green`` : done quantity corresponds to the expected quantity
* ``red``: done quantity is over the expected quantity

**Typical Errors and Warning at the login screen**

* It will not possible to log in if the user is not member of the
  'Warehouse / User' group.


**Typical Errors and Warning at the scanner screen**

* 'Incorrect quantity' if the quantity entered is negative, or is not a float.

* 'Barcode not found in the picking' if the operator tries to scan a product
  that is not in the list of move lines.

* 'Many operations found' if there are many lines with the same products.
  In that case, the operator should select manually the line he want to treat.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* For the time being, this module doesn't handle 'Lot', 'Pack' and 'Owner'.

* The UI doesn't allow to add an unexpected product on the fly.
