==============================
Generate Barcodes for Partners
==============================

This module expands Odoo functionality, allowing user to generate barcode
depending on a given barcode rule for Partners.

For example, a typical pattern for partners is  "042........." that means
that:
* the EAN13 code will begin by '042'
* followed by 0 digits (named Barcode Base in this module)
* a 13 digit control

With this module, it is possible to:

* Assign a pattern (barcode.rule) to a res.partner

* Define a Barcode base: 
    * manually, if the base of the barcode must be set by a user. (typically an
      internal code defined in your company)
    * automaticaly by a sequence, if you want to let Odoo to increment a
      sequence. (typical case of a customer number incrementation)

* Generate a barcode, based on the defined pattern and the barcode base

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, see the 'Configuration' Section of the description
of the module 'barcodes_generator_abstract'

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Dependency to point_of_sale is required because barcode field, defined in 'base'
module (in the res.partner model), is defined in a 'point_of_sale' view.

It's a relative problem, because barcodes generation for partners will occures
mostly in a Point of Sale context, to give barcodes to customers.

You could comment 'point_of_sale' dependencies if you want to use this module
without point of sale installed.
