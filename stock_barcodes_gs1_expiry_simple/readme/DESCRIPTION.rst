This module is a glue module between the module **stock_barcodes** from `github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-barcode <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-barcode/>`_ and the module **product_expiry_simple** from `github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/>`_.

The OCA module **product_expiry_simple** is an equivalent of the official module **product_expiry** that add a single date field on lots for the expiry date (instead of adding 4 datetime fields).
